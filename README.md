# Kano_Model_Analysis_with_Python

As my internship company needed to decide which features they should included in their new products, I programmed python to implement Kano Model to analyze the customer survey to know which features are desired by customers and which are not.

Due to company privacy, I did not include the real collected data here. The data shown here was made up by myself. This code is only to show how I utilized Python to implement the model.

## What is Kano Model?

The Kano Model (pronounced “kah-no”) is an approach to prioritizing features on a product roadmap based on the degree to which they are likely to satisfy customers. Product teams can weigh a high-satisfaction feature against its costs to implement, to determine whether or not adding it to the roadmap is a strategically sound decision.

The Kano Model is one of many prioritization frameworks designed to help product teams prioritize initiatives. Kano can help teams determine which features will satisfy and even delight customers. Product managers often use the Kano Model to prioritize potential new features by grouping them into categories. These feature categories can range from those that could disappoint customers, to those likely to satisfy or even delight customers.
